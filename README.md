# Name of the project: 
GadgetHeaven âœ¨


## A brief description:
I have developed a responsive e-commerce platform for Gadget Haven, a gadget-buying website, based on a detailed Figma design. The site features a structured navigation bar, product categories, and individual product details pages. Key functionalities include a shopping cart, a wish-list system, and product filtering. Local storage has been used for data persistence and managing the cart and wish-list. Additional pages have been added for users to view and manage their cart and wish-list, sort items by price, and ensure a smooth user experience. The site has been made to prevent errors when reloading.
